# MSc-Statistics_Project
- The project aims to analyze PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) bus service data to evaluate operational efficiency, identify underperforming routes, and support data-driven transport planning. The goal is to provide insights that can help improve service quality, ridership, and revenue generation.
#### Project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on ridership trends, depot performance, and route efficiency
- Visualizations (bar plots, line charts, heatmaps) for insights
- Identification of key issues affecting performance (e.g., low revenue routes)
- Suggestions for improving operational efficiency
